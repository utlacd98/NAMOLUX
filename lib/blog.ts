Community participation (Reddit, LinkedIn, Twitter) is the fastest free method. SEO is the most sustainable but takes the longest to show results." },
      { question: "Is social media traffic worth pursuing?", answer: "Yes, but it should be a supplement, not your primary strategy.

      { question: "What's a realistic first-year revenue goal for a solo SaaS founder?", answer: "Every product is different, but a realistic goal for a focused solo founder is £1,000-£5,000 MRR (monthly recurring revenue) by month 12. That requires approximately 50-250 customers at £20/month. Sounds modest — but at £5,000 MRR, you have a real business." },

In early stage, it's often better to offer a free trial (14-30 days) rather than a permanent free tier. Free trials convert better and filter for serious users." }
